# Job Creation
The Jobs Page is your overview for all jobs and their respective job state. (**_Pre-construction, Currently active, Overdue, Completed_**)
The Currently Active status is required for a Job to be visible and accessible across the platform. Only active jobs can be used or updated by the assigned users

Company Admins, typically the owner or designated office personnel will be able to set-up various Jobs and their details with the "Create New Job" button.

Enter all the relevant data for your jobs as required by each entry field and proceed from there.
Do note, that you can always come back to edit jobs as needed so for fields that you cannot fill at this time (Teams etc.) you can return later with no worries.

Once you've entered the basic data, you can click on the blue button to create the new Job

You can now begin filling in additional details for the Job, especially key dynamic fields that are used across other modules, such as:
- [Foremen](https://whistledrywallapp.com/users/usersTable/)
- [Vendors](https://whistledrywallapp.com/purchase-orders/vendors/)
- [General Client (or Contractor)](https://whistledrywallapp.com/change-order-requests/contractors/)
- Geofence Settings — including Radius, Latitude, and Longitude, if you want to enable the Geofence feature to ensure users can only clock in within a designated area around the job site.
If you’re unsure how to obtain the coordinates for your job site, feel free to contact us. Just provide the job site address and the approximate radius in miles, and we’ll help you set it up.

Once you're done filling in the fields you can click on the **_Save changes_** button at the bottom right hand side of the page.

At any time, you can click on a Job row to view more details. This includes access to additional actions, such as importing or re-importing a **Budget** and **Schedule of Values (SOV)**.

Once you're satisfied with the job information, we recommend moving onto [Uploading your Budget and SOV](https://help.whistledrywallapp.com/Jobs/uploading-your-budgets-and-sov/) to the relevant Job.
