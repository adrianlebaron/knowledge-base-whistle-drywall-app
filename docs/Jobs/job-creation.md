# Job Creation
The Jobs Page is your (client) overview for all jobs and their respective job state. (Active, Pre-Prod, etc.)

Company Admins, typically the owner or designated office personnel will be able to set-up various Jobs and their details with the "Create New Job" button.

Enter all the relevant data for your jobs as required by each entry field and proceed from there.
Do note, that you can always come back to edit jobs as needed so for fields that you cannot fill at this time (Teams etc.) you can return later with no worries.

Once you've entered all the relevant fields, the page will look similar to the image above.
Admins should take their time filling in the relevant fields here as they need.
Do note that sub-level staff will not be able to see any jobs that are not set to "currently active" so ensure Admins set this status to avoid issues later.

Once you're done filling in the fields you can and hit "Save" at the bottom right hand side of the page, you may return to the jobs page and locate the job which will look similar to the image above.

If your job is not showing, you may have forgotten to set the job to the correct job status and you can always filter by job statuses which defaults to "Currently Active" jobs, shown below.

Jobs are filtered this way as the Whistle App may also function as your long-term database for future reference.

Once you're satisfied with the job information, we recommend moving onto uploading your Budget and SOV data to the relevant Job Uploading your Budgets and SOV

Or moving onto setting up the relevant members of your various teams and users.
