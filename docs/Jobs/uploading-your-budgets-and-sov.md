# Uploading your Budgets and SOV

Uploading your Budgets and Schedule of Values (SOV) to each relevant job is an easy yet important step of utilizing the Whistle App to its full potential.

To start, head over to the Jobs Page.

If you currently do not have any Jobs created or active jobs please reference the following article:Job Creation

Once you're on the Jobs Page, locate the relevant Job that you are uploading data to and take note of the following buttons below.



To start, we'll work on uploading your budget.

Click the button and download the Whistle App Budget Template to a folder or location you can easily reference later as you will need to upload it into the App once you are finished.

After downloading, open the Budget Excel File which will look like the image below.



Do note, that working with your relevant "Qualified Project Manager" is important for the following steps or working with our training team to maximize efficiency in utilizing this feature.

Take note of the two pages of this Excel file.
One is for your Products Master List.
The other is for your Service Master List.

A qualified Project Manager should be able to convert your existing data or formats into this new format easily, if needed the Whistle App team can provide training help to assist with transitioning your data into the Whistle App friendly format.

Take note, any fields that are going to be left blank should be filled in with a dash mark or hyphen (-) and not left fully blank.

Once you are finished filling in your data, you may upload the updated Excel file into the Whistle App via the same button you utilized to find the download link.

If you successfully upload the Excel file, your job should now have new buttons shown below.



If you have errors in uploading, please verify with your qualified Project Manager that all fields were inputted correctly.

The new buttons allow you to view your data within the Whistle App as shown below.





You may sort and filter your line items easily via this page, clicking each line item also allows you to create a purchase order. If you need help with that, please see the following article: Creating and managing your Purchase Orders

Take note to make any corrections necessary before proceeding as we highly discourage attempting re-uploads and making changes once your team has begun utilizing the data within the Whistle App, if there are items that need to be added later for billing, invoicing, etc, there are ways to do this outside of this system.

Let's now work on uploading your SOV by clicking the Import SOV button. This functions similarly to Importing your Budget.



As we understand that multiple vendors, clients, GC's, and companies have different ways of providing an SOV, we made it as simple as possible for anyone to convert their data into a Whistle App friendly format.

As before, please take your time with your qualified Project Manager to fill this in as correctly as possible before proceeding.

If items need to be added later, you can utilize the Change Order feature or other methods to do so as we highly discourage making changes or re-uploading once work has begun on the job.



Once you're done and move onto seeing your SOV, you can double check all your data within the See SOV page and make updates here.

The Budget and SOV tools allow you to track your project progress and other various details accurately and provides ways for you and your team to maximize efficiency and potentially profits from your jobs.

Speaking of profits and tracking your jobs, we suggest looking into utilizing our Bills feature: Create and Manage Your BIllsor utilizing the Invoice tracking feature here: Managing your Invoices
