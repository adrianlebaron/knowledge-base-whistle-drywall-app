The Whistle Drywall App has a Teams Module for managing your crews and teams per job and allows for in-depth time and task tracking to increase efficiency for your organization as a whole.

The Teams Module gives you an overview of your pre-existing teams or allows you to create a new team.

Note, we suggest [Creating and Managing your Users](https://knowledge-base-whistledrywallapp.netlify.app/User%20Management/creating-and-managing-users/) beforehand as the Teams Module works better with our User Module utilized.

Let's create new teams now.

Clicking the Create New Team button pops up with the dialogue box for you to input a Team name.

Once you've created the team, the Teams Module page will have your new team created and now we can edit it further.

Clicking the Edit button will show you the Team management page.

From this page you can assign the Team to specific jobs that you want to give the Team access to for task management and time tracking.

You can even leave comments as reminders for your Staff/Management members to understand who or what this team is for.

Once you've configured your team, the page would look something like this.

Once you're satisfied with the changes, you can save from here and you're done.

The workers and users assigned to the team will now have access to the job assigned and can start working from there.

We suggest looking into creating and managing your vendors or working on your worker contracts from here.
