#Managing your Invoices
The Whistle Drywall App's Invoice module allows you or your qualified staff members to create and track invoices for your all your jobs giving you an easy way to see all the payments going in for your jobs.

From the main dashboard, you can access the Invoice module via the admin tab.



Selecting the module will open up your Invoice overview where you can see all Invoices listed and create new ones.

Do note, your qualified staff member or accounting team can easily convert your existing systems into the Whistle Drywall App system or if you need extra help, our support team would be glad to help.

The ID's listed are also generated for the Whistle Drywall App and it is imperative that your qualified staff members or accounting department keep track of these numbers to appropriately assign to your pay apps for extensive record keeping.



Your Invoices and their status will be listed here, you also have several options to view, edit, download, and email the invoice directly to your client contact.

Please work with your qualified staff team or accounting department to carefully and correctly utilize this module.
