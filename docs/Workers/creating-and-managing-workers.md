The Whistle Drywall App has a Worker contract module that allows you to manage specific workers that have specific contracts that you have negotiated and provides you an overview for all the worker contracts you have for your organization.

The Worker Contracts module page shows you an overview of all existing worker contracts and allows you to easily create new ones.

Let's do that now.

The dialogue box will populate with choices from your existing jobs and your Users and Vendors.
If you're missing an option double check those modules before creating the Worker Contract.

Once you've created the Worker Contract, you can now start editing the services that are assigned to this worker for the job linked.

You can add items to the Worker contract straight from the SML linked to the job [Uploading your Budgets and SOV](https://help.whistledrywallapp.com/Jobs/uploading-your-budgets-and-sov/) or from your global services list.

Assign the correct values to each service and save.

Once you're finished, you can now easily create Bills or have them create Bills for your organization to pay out. [Create and Manage Your BIlls](https://help.whistledrywallapp.com/Bills/create-and-manage-your-bills/)
