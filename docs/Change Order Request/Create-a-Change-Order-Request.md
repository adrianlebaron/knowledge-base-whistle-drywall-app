# Creating a Change Order Request

Let’s create your first Change Order Request (COR). Don’t worry if this is your first time — this guide walks you through every step in a simple and clear way.

## Accessing the COR Module

To get started, locate the **COR module** in the left-side menu under the **Admin** dropdown.

You’ll see a table listing your existing CORs, including:

- COR Number
- Subject
- Created By
- Date Created
- Status
- Job
- Total

To create a new COR, click the **New** button in the top-right corner.

## COR Creation Interface

After clicking **New**, you’ll be taken to the COR creation screen where you’ll enter all needed details. The page is divided into simple, organized sections.

---

## 1. Select the Job

Start by selecting the **Job** the COR belongs to:

1. Click the **Job dropdown**
2. Choose the job from the list

## 2. Enter Basic Information

Fill in the following fields:

## 3. Set the Status

Select the COR status from:

- Pending

## 4. Approved Amount (Optional)

The **Approved Amount** field (grey background) is for CORs that were approved **before** being added to the app.

You can skip this if it’s a new COR.

## 7. Select Client Contact

At the bottom of the page, choose the **Client Contact** who will receive the COR.

If no client is assigned to the job, the system will notify you to add one first.

## 8. Add Materials, Equipment, and Labor

These final sections let you add cost items.

### Add Material

Fill in:

- Name  
- Quantity

The total is calculated automatically.

When typing the Name, the system suggests items from your global material list.

### Add Labor

Same process as equipment and materials.

## 9. Apply Markup

Enter a markup percentage.  
The system automatically calculates the markup amount and updates the final total.
