#Creating and Managing Users
Creating and managing your Users is an important part of integrating the Whistle App into your company's workflow.

Head to the User Management page as shown below.





This module lists all of your various users that have been created for your company.
Your verified administrators can create, edit, and remove users from this page.

You can search and locate all your users through this page and later add them to various teams for job access.

Click the New User button to create a new User.





Fill in all the relevant details for the User and hit register.

Locate the User that you would like to continue editing permissions for and hit View Profile.



This is your master control page for the specific user, the users you create will ONLY have access to specific modules if provided the correct permissions.

Please be careful in providing access to users as you want to create each user to only have access to modules that will be relevant to their job within your organization.

Providing admin level access to all users is not recommended for your organization's security and to avoid unnecessary issues while working within the Whistle App.

For example, I would like this Test User to be a Foreman.



I will click the relevant checkbox for Test User and hit apply then move back to View Profile and the new options for permissions will appear.



Being meticulous in your approach to creating and managing users will allow your organization to work effectively and efficiently within the Whistle App and will provide you the peace of mind that your organization is being managed well.

Once you've created a few users, we suggest assigning them to Teams; Creating and Managing Your Teams so you can assign them to specific Jobs; Job Creation
