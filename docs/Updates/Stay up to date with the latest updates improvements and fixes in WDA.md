## October 2025 Release Notes – Whistle Drywall App 

### 🚀 New Features

- **Smarter Search in Dropdowns**  
  You can now quickly search for Jobs and Vendors when creating a Purchase Order. No more endless scrolling—just type to find what you need instantly.

- **Create Bills Directly from Purchase Orders**  
  Save time and reduce errors with the new “Create Bill from PO” feature. When converting a PO, the app automatically pulls in all product items, making your billing process faster and more accurate.

### 🧠 Improvements & Enhancements

- **Better Search Everywhere**  
  We’ve expanded the searchable dropdown filters across key sections, including:  
  - Invoices  
  - Worker Contracts  
  - Bills  
  - Payments  
  - Teams  
  - Tasks  
  This makes it easier to find what you need, wherever you’re working.

- **Cleaner, More Organized Sidebar**  
  Your sidebar menu items are now sorted alphabetically for faster navigation and consistency.

- **Improved User Activity Tracking**  
  Admins can now see activity from both the web and mobile apps (iOS + Android). The “Last Active” column now reflects true usage across all platforms.

- **Mobile Web Enhancements**  
  Added Account Settings and Logout buttons to the mobile navigation bar—so you can easily manage your account and sign out from any device.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Pagination in Purchase Orders**  
  Fixed a display issue where page numbers would overflow when there were many pages. Pagination now stays neatly within view.

- **Bill PDF Labeling**  
  Resolved an issue where Bills incorrectly labeled the Payee as “Worker.” Now all Bills correctly show “Payee,” whether it’s a Vendor or a Worker.

- **Vendor Contact Editing**  
  Fixed an issue preventing contact edits when a Job name contained an apostrophe (’). You can now freely update vendor contact details.

## September 2025 Release Notes – Whistle Drywall App

### 🚀 New Features

- **Vendor** and **Worker** columns are now unified into a single **Payee** column, simplifying data presentation.  
- **Action buttons** across all modules have been standardized for consistency.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed incorrect metadata on Bill PDF pages — browser tab now displays **“Bill”** instead of “Purchase Order.”  
- Fixed an issue in the **Teams** module where pressing Enter in the search box caused an error.  
- Fixed an issue in **Invoices** where adding multiple payments caused an error — now users can add several payments without issue.  
- Resolved a **data alignment issue** when editing payments; payment details now stay correctly aligned.
