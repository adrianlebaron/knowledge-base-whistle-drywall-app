#Create and Manage Your BIlls
The Whistle Drywall App has a bills module for tracking what your company owes specific workers and allows you to have an overview of where funds are being allocated and paid out.





Selecting the module will list your existing Bills and allow you to create new ones.

If you have workers invoicing you for specific work or if you know which bills need to be created we can easily create one within this module.

Let's create a new Bill from an existing Job. Job Creation



If you currently haven't uploaded your budget and SOV for your existing jobs consider doing it now. Uploading your Budgets and SOV

When you click the button it will pop up with the following box.



Select the relevant job you want to create a bill for and Go To Service Master List. Pro tip, you can reach the following page by viewing your SML in the relevant Job as well.

Once you reach the page, you will have a list of all the services outlined by your SML assigned to the job.

For this example we'll select a few relevant items that we know we need a bill for.



Once you've selected the relevant items, the Create Bill button will pop up.

If you're having trouble locating the relevant services, you can sort via the text boxes as well.

Once you're satisfied with your selections hit Create Bill.



A pop up where you can assign a vendor or worker to the bill will show.
If you haven't created workers or vendors we suggest doing it now. Creating and Managing Vendors Create and Manage Workers

Assign the correct worker or vendor and proceed to create the bill.



It will lead to this page with all the relevant information for the Worker or Vendor and the services that were selected earlier.

Please take your time to review the items here and you can always edit it later if needed prior to approving the Bill.

Your qualified staff member or accounting team member can always double check things here. If you haven't created a User account for one, you may do so now to help manage your Bills.
Creating and Managing Users

Once you're satisfied with the details in the Bill, you can hit save and go back to the Bill module overview.



Once these Bills are appropriately paid out, your qualified staff member can assign them as paid and you'll have a record with the exact services and dollar amounts assigned.

The Bills module is a good way to check what bills have been paid and what currently need to be paid out per job.

We also suggest checking the Invoice Module to track where and when money will be coming in from Jobs. Managing your Invoices
